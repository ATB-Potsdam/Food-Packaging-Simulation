The simulation program provides a flexible system to input predefined supply chain conditions and the properties of fresh produce and packaging material, thus, minimizing the costly and time-consuming experimental procedures for selecting the optimum packaging material for fresh produce. Produce-package-atmosphere systems are integrated into the form of ordinary differential equations and solved using numerical methods in MATLAB.
•	The simulation program is useful for designing the size and number of perforations to achieve equilibrium modified atmosphere packaging (EMAP) alone or in combination with packaging material having a higher water transmission rate or active moisture absorber. 
•	The simulation program is also useful for predicting the shelf life of fresh produce under the actual supply chain conditions.
